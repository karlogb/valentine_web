# 💕 Valentine's Day Interactive Page

This is a fun and interactive Valentine's Day webpage where the user is asked if they want to be with you on Valentine's Day. If they try to refuse, they are given multiple chances until they inevitably say "Yes"! 😆

## 🎨 Features
- **Cute and responsive design** 🥰
- **Interactive "No" button** that moves away after multiple refusals 😈
- **Animated background with falling hearts** 💖
- **Smooth CSS animations for a delightful experience**
- **Custom GIFs to enhance the fun**

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/valentine-page.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## 📂 File Structure
```
📁 valentine-page
├── 📄 index.html      # Main page
├── 📄 no1.html        # First rejection
├── 📄 no2.html        # Second rejection
├── 📄 no3.html        # Final rejection with moving "No" button
├── 📄 yes.html        # Success page
├── 🎨 style.css       # CSS styles
├── 🎭 script.js       # Interactive button logic
└── 🎨 images/         # All images and GIFs
```

## 🎭 How It Works
1. The user is asked **"Will you be my Valentine?"** ❤️
2. If they click "Yes", they go to the success page.
3. If they click "No", they are redirected to progressively more desperate pages. 🥺
4. On the final page, the "No" button starts running away, making it impossible to refuse. 😈

## 📌 Customization
- **Change the question or styling** by modifying `index.html` and `style.css`.
- **Add new GIFs** by placing them inside the `images/` folder and updating the paths in the HTML.
- **Modify the button behavior** by editing `script.js`.
